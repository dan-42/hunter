Hunter CI testing
=================

This repository is for deep per-package testing.
The only pull requests accepting here is about continuous integration testing on Travis/AppVeyor, i.e. should only affect ``.travis.yml`` or ``appveyor.yml`` (in some rare cases ``jenkins.py``). Please contribute other stuff to https://github.com/ruslo/hunter.
* `Per package testing table <https://github.com/cpp-pm/hunter-testing/branches/all>`_

Thanks.
